## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Senior Mobile Engineer** with 10+ years of experience building, scaling, and maintaining production mobile applications for **Android and iOS**.

I specialize in **Android (Kotlin, Java, MVVM)** and **cross-platform development with React Native and Expo**.  
I’m also the founder of a mobile app company where I’ve led the full product lifecycle — from architecture and development to publishing, monetization, and scaling.

📈 My apps have reached **5+ million total downloads**.

In addition to hands-on development, I’ve **led Android development as a technical reference**, owning architecture decisions, mentoring developers, and reviewing code while remaining fully hands-on.
